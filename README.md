## The Task

For Project #2, we had to build a full stack ecommerce website that utilizes node.js, express.js, handlebars.js, MySQL, Sequelize ORM, GET/POST routes, authentication (express-session and cookies), API keys, all with MVC paradigm. 

## Description

Cash4Cache is a web based application that allows users to post and browse listings for used memory devices (CPUs, GPUs, and Memory Cards).

Cash4Cache was built using Express, Handlebars, JavaScript, Bulma CSS, Sessions, Sequelize, MySql, NodeMailer, Helmet, and BodyParser.


## User Story

```
AS a Computer User who shops online
I WANT to see listings for specific data devices at a discounted price
SO THAT I donâ€™t waste my time on department store sites with infinite choices.
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am searching for data devices
WHEN I log into the site
THEN I am presented with a list of previous postings
WHEN I want to upload my own device
THEN I am able to upload and post that device
```
